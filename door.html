      <p>The man blinks.
<br>
The two doors are utterly identical.
<br>
Alike in every way, down to the grain of the wood and the warp of the paneling. Down to the dark stains leaking from the hinge, something that could be paint.
<br>
"It's paint," he says aloud. "It's just...really dark, congealed...paint."
<br>
He is very aware it is not paint.
<br>
"Hello?" he says ignoring the bleeding doors in favor of scanning the room. It's bare of furniture, beige wallpaper curling down like dried— okay, no, it's just wallpaper. It's just wallpaper.
<br>
"Right, then." The man clears his throat, facing the doors again. They're still identical.
<br>
IT IS POLITE TO KNOCK a rattling voice slinks through his head, and the man stops breathing. It’s coming from behind the door on the left - no. No, it’s definitely coming from the door on the right, muffled behind the thick mahogany. It’s the right. Which means the left door is clear. Which means the left door is the way out.
<br>
He squares his shoulders before the door on the left, and raises his fist.
<br>
KNOCK KNOCK.
<br>
WHO IS IT?
<br>
The voice is coming from the door directly in front of him.
<br>
The man’s stomach drops like a stone. He tries to move, to get away as the door begins to creak open, but it’s too late. It was always too late, because he’d picked wrong, and the long, thin black legs reach from the door and he is gone.
<br>
The man blinks.
<br>
The two doors are utterly identical.
<br>
"Christ," he gasps, stumbling backwards and nearly hitting the far wall. The doors stare him down, not a droplet of...paint out of place between them. "Okay, I...okay."
<br>
This time. This time, he just needs to— to listen. To look closer. There’s no way he can know for sure, as maddening as that is, but there is right choice, he just has to choose it.
<br>
The door on the left seems…different this time. Tenser, somehow. Like something is waiting behind it.
<br>
KNOCK KNOCK
<br>
The door on the right doesn’t open at first. The man’s heart leaps, relief singing through his veins. This time it’s different, this time he chose right—
<br>
WHO IS IT?
<br>
The man doesn’t even have time to scream. The door whips open and long limbs are wrapping around him, bristled hairs cutting into him and—
<br>
The man blinks.
<br>
The two doors are utterly identical.
<br>
He squeezes his eyes shut, catching his breath.
<br>
This time, he doesn’t study the thick substance still oozing out from beneath the door. He doesn’t bother listening to what sounds might be scratching just behind the wood. This time he lifts his arm and watches the air around it. It’s the strings. It has to be the strings. He can’t have chosen wrong this many times, it’s not possible. It's improbable.
<br>
It’s this place. It’s making him choose the wrong door. He just has to see the strings.
<br>
"I see you," he hisses. He doesn't, but that doesn't matter. "I see you, this time."
<br>
Very carefully, he reaches for the door on the left. The air around his wrist remains empty and loose and dull, nothing shimmering or tugging as his knuckles meet the wood.
<br>
KNOCK KNOCK.
<br>
He waits, not daring to hope he’d figured it out. But then, he had. Of course he had, it had been the strings guiding him to the wrong door, keeping him from finding the way out. He’s done it, he’s made the right choice this time and—
<br>
WHO IS IT?
<br>
He tries to run. The hideous, grasping legs pull him into the dark.
<br>
The man blinks.
<br>
The two doors are utterly identical.
<br>
He frantically scrubs his hands all over himself, ruffling the already-disheveled folds of his clothes, trying to scrape away any threads, any strings that had led him— again— to the wrong door. If he can’t see them, maybe he can feel them. He swipes along his arms, the skin taut and unmarred and free of anything clinging. There’s nothing, there is nothing, he should be able to choose now. To choose the right one.
<br>
He swallows, facing the doors.
<br>
"Fine," he says, pretending his voice is flat and even and unimpressed. "Fine."
<br>
He raises his trembling fist to knock.
<br>
KNOCK KNOCK.
<br>
WHO IS IT?
<br>
The man loses count of how many times he is dragged across the threshold, how many times he searches himself for those grey threads he knows must be there, he can’t be choosing wrong every time, it’s— it’s statistically impossible, he can’t be making the wrong decision every single time out of what feels like hundreds of blank-faced doors. It’s flipping a penny and every one is tails. It shouldn’t be possible.
<br>
"You aren't possible," he informs the door on the right through gritted teeth, and raises his hand to knock.
<br>
KNOCK KNOCK.
<br>
WHO IS IT?
<br>
Hideously long legs lunge from the door.
<br>
The man blinks.
<br>
The two doors are utterly identical.
<br>
He's about to petulantly kick the nearest door and hope it doesn't count as knocking, when another voice pipes up.
<br>
“Hello?”
<br>
The man startles, looking to the right. On the step of the other leaking doorway stands a stranger. Or— no. No, is it a stranger? She….looks familiar. Sort of. Not really, but maybe. She could be somebody he knows. She isn't. But she could be.
<br>
“Please,” the stranger says. “Please, I— I don’t know what’s happening. I don’t know where I am, or how to get out, I—“
<br>
“It’s okay,” the man tries to reassure, even though his own hands have been shaking for what might as well have been years. “It’s alright, we— we just have to choose the right door. I can do it this time.”
<br>
He faces the doors. He can feel sweat beading on his brow, pooling at his back. He can’t choose the wrong door this time. He cannot choose wrong.
<br>
“I think…” he says, after several minutes. There’s less...liquid at the bottom, not as much warping along the edge of the wood. Or no— maybe that’s because it’s a trick, reverse psychology of a kind making him think that this means safety. “I, uh…just a second. I...”
<br>
The stranger’s eyes are on him, beseeching.
<br>
“Um.” He gestures at the door on the left. “This one. Yes, it’s—“
<br>
The stranger pushes past him, hammering on the door.
<br>
“Please!” she shouts. “Please, let us out, please—“
<br>
WHO IS IT?
<br>
The door screeches open. The stranger’s eyes go wide with terror.
<br>
“NO!” the man screams, throwing himself at the stranger’s hands as they vanish into the dark.  He barely catches himself on the doorframe from pitching through it himself. His heart it in his throat, and he chokes on it. “No, no, no—I'm sorry, I'm so sorry, I—”
<br>
For a heartbeat he is paralyzed on the threshold, one hand braced on the frame as the sound of something wet and heavy being torn apart from the dark. Every part of him is shaking. He chose wrong, he chose wrong, he chose wrong, and this is all his—
<br>
He doesn’t get to finish the thought.
<br>
The man blinks.
<br>
The two doors are utterly identical.
<br>
"Fuck," he pants, pointing at the door and staggering back. "You. I'm not—no. No, no. I'm not—I'm not doing this anymore! You can't—"
<br>
“Excuse me?” He jumps again, and turns his neck numbly to the stranger next to him. He is hunched, and elderly, and he looks terrified. “Ca-can you help me?”
<br>
I really, really can't, the man wants to say. Find somebody else, literally any other person, because I am somehow defying all probability and making the wrong choice over and over and over and over and. And.
<br>
The man nods, mouth dry.
<br>
“I..yes, I…I can do it this time.”
<br>
KNOCK KNOCK
<br>
WHO IS IT?
<br>
Sometimes he is alone. Sometimes he is not. It’s always a stranger, always somebody he never even gets the chance to know. Somebody who somehow trusts him to make the decision, to get them out of this place. Somebody who pleads for help or shouts in angered urgency or shakes in panic— it matters, but it doesn’t, because they all end up the same way. He picks a door. He is somehow, improbably, ridiculously, always wrong.
<br>
The man blinks.
<br>
The two doors are utterly identical.
<br>
“What do you want?” he shouts at the doors, the thing behind one of them. “What do you want from me, I can’t— I’m not—“
<br>
IT IS POLITE TO KNOCK that awful, slinking voice says, directly into his head. No, it doesn’t, it’s coming from the left. No. The right. No, it’s— it’s trying to trick him, it’s the left, the left is the way out, the left has to be the way out because despite everything he knows that one of these doors will lead out of this room.
<br>
The man’s hands twitch across his arms, reflexively searching for threads that must be there. He finds none.
<br>
“Please,” he says weakly, raising his fist to the door on the left. “Please, I-I don’t want—“
<br>
KNOCK KNOCK
<br>
WHO IS IT?
<br>
The door creaks open. The man sobs. He is wrenched once again into the dark.
<br>
The man blinks.
<br>
The two doors are—
<br>
There’s a creak of hinges.
<br>
“Jon?”
<br>
